  title: Forecasting the 2018 US midterms: A social panel approach
  institute: University of Manchester/NYU
  url: 
  abstract: "Previous publications have sought to forecast elections using twitter data, with inconclusive results regarding the efficacy of the endeavour. This is likely due to under-developed and under-theorised methods as well as significant and uncertain bias resulting from the unrepresentative nature of the population of twitter users, leading many in the field to conclude that it is a futile, pseudo-scientific pursuit. 

In this paper, I introduce new methodologies which provide a theory- driven and evidence-based framework for twitter-based election forecast- ing. I use the upcoming 2018 midterm elections in the USA as a test case, following a ’social panel’ of US twitter users who have previously voted. Using network-based user geo-locating, image classification with neural networks on profile images, and first name census-likelihood matching, I estimate the panel’s socio-demographics, i.e. home location, race and gender. This allows for panel stratification and weighting. 

I forecast vote shares for the national popular vote, as well as all 33 senate races and 39 gubernatorial races. These forecasts will be dynamically updated and documented online, starting in April/May 2018, thus addressing a key critique of the literature to date, stating that the vast majority of publications were post-hoc, fitted psuedo-forecasts."

  title: Early indicators of the number of visitors to museums based on Google data
  speaker: Federico Botta

  abstract: "The number of visitors to museums is a key indicator of the performance of cultural institutions. Being able to have early estimates of visits is of crucial importance for cultural policy makers who need to allocate resources and funding, or to evaluate the impact of cultural policies. 

Traditional data gathering and processing methods result in delayed estimates on the number of visitors to free museums. Here, we show how our information gathering process using the online search engine Google could help policy makers have early and accurate estimates of the number of people visiting a museum or gallery. Additionally, we present a tool which allows cultural policy makers to easily explore the analysis and interact with the data in a non-technical manner. 

Our results provide further evidence that publicly available data sets detailing our online behaviour can be used to better understand the current state of society."
