  A two-day meeting to present recent developments in data science. This year's meeting is jointly organised by Manchester's Data Science Institute and the Cathie Marsh Centre for Social Research and will explore some of the ways that data science can support societal wellbeing. Invited speakers will include leading data scientists from industry and academia and there will also be the opportunity to submit abstracts for talks and posters. Talks will range from application-focussed to advanced data science methodologies.
